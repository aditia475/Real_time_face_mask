# Real_time_face_mask
> *"Real-Time Face Mask Detection"* (03/2022):- 
Completed using OpenCV library of Python and implemented using SVM *(Support Vector Machine)* -ML Algorithm

OVERVIEW: - 
> *Collect Face-related Data (with and without mask) -> Train Data Using SVM ML Algorithm -> Prediction on Live Data Using a Camera*

FILES -
> 1. Face_mask_Detection.py [Perform Face Detection and Collect Face-Related Data -> Both Kinds of data are stored as numpy(.npy) files]
> 2. Fcae_mask_det_1.py 
> [Load the data and reshape it to make it 2D -> Assign Labels for 'Mask and 'No Mask' -> Train the SVM ML Model -> Test in Real-Time]
